# Decision Tree

Train Data on Gray images, RGB images, PCA features, Sobel Edges. Results of Sobel Edges Features was better compare to others. In order to ipincrease the performance Tried Pruning.
    
# Random Forests
   
Used Scikit-Learn Library for implementing Random Forests. Tried to see performance of various hyper parameters like  Different number of trees etc. Train data that we used was Gray images, RGB images & K-means clustered images.
