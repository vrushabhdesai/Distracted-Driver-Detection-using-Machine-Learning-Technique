# Convolutional Neural Network

Trained model on 100x100 sized RGB images data set using TensorFlow.

Explored various hyper parameters such as:

      Number of Kernels and Kernel Size in convolution layer

      Number of Neurons in hidden layer

      Number of Epochs

      Optimizer: Adam and SGD

      Learning Rate in SGD

      Number of  CNN Layers and Hidden Layers 
      
# VGG16 Architecture

VGG16 is used for Deep Convolutional Networks for Large Scale Image Recognition. Test Accuracy achieved is 98.28%. VGG16 model generalizes very well compare to other machine learning algorithms.
